# 0. Introduction
This repository contains the source code for our SIGCOMM'22 paper "Multi-Resource Interleaving for Deep Learning Training".


# 1. Content
- **simulator/** contains code for simulation and is adapted from [Tiresias](https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Tiresias). Please refer to ```<repo>/simulator/README.md``` for detailed information.
- **cluster_exp/** contains code for real-cluster experiment. Please refer to ```<repo>/cluster_exp/README.md``` for detailed information.


# 2. Reproduce results (for SIGCOMM'22 artifact evaluation)
Please refer to ```<repo>/simulator/README.md``` and ```<repo>/cluster_exp/README.md``` for details.

Note: Due to the execution scripts of testbed experiments are highly related to intracompany platform, we only demonstrate the functionality and show the pseudocode of the related scripts (e.g., run.sh, prepare_env.sh). Please adjust to your platform if you would like to execute the testbed experiment.
